# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I mostly played around with copilot. I implemented the conditional rendering of the logout button when the user is loged-in, in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** I was a bit frustrated because the actual functionality did not really work, so I am leaving it to tomorrow.

### Day 1: July 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on fixing the Context issue I had in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** At first I was quite overwhelmed because I did not understand why my user's token was not being saved, this was preventing me from making progress with other functionalities. I finally think I found the reason, is the authContext. The issue is not fixed but I am slowly piecing everything together.

### Day 2: July 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I focused in doing the styles of the Auth App I am creating

**Thoughts:** I am using the global styles of a tutorial, but is quite a complete suite. I think I will work on it an tweak it to make it more mine, is very handy to have a kind of base styles sheet that you can start from in most projects.

### Day 3: July 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today is Sunday. I spent most of my time figuring WordPress out and how to work it locally with XAMPP 

**Thoughts:** I was so clueless, because is a very different set-up than MERN applications

### Day 4: July 8, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today i am bussing, I fixed a bug in my Auth App that was impeding the login to work properly and the deployment issues I was having in Vercel are also gone :) 

**Thoughts:** happy ^^

### Day 7: July 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I was doing the HTML of this website for a technical task for a WordPress developer role, I have been working on it all day, I think another day and the front end part could be done. 

**Thoughts:** I wanna understand better how to organise efficiently my html/css sheets because it can get quite messy very quickly

### Day 8: July 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: i made progress refactoring the styles and thinking a bit more about how to properly css  

**Thoughts:** not as obvious as I thought at first, I still have a great deal of experimentation ahead of me I think

### Day 12: July 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I spent so much time traying to understand how to use sass today, and I broke the remote server because of a sftp request that i think included my local database conection details, and replaced the remote db conection details and now I have a 505. Not the best day 

**Thoughts:** breaking is part of the process https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219264748209467394/

### Day 13: July 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I really feel I started understanding what sass is about 

**Thoughts:** is good if you wanna be modular, I love that you can create mixins which are ultimately like functions that take parameters. Quite cool

### Day 14: July 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: spent most of the day understanding how I was going to do the backend part, without having access to the WordPress dashboard of the original ines-test project. In the end I installed a backup of that in a new WordPress in my own server (so that I can control and fix if I break something) 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 15: July 19, 2024

### Day 17: July 21, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: very annoying day, when I started working on my document the HTML version was not the latest, somehow yesterday's work hadn't been saved. So I had to map everything again and fix an issue with the script. It felt like a wasted day in terms of progress.
