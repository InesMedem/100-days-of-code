# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I mostly played around with copilot. I implemented the conditional rendering of the logout button when the user is loged-in, in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** I was a bit frustrated because the actual functionality did not really work, so I am leaving it to tomorrow.

### Day 1: July 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on fixing the Context issue I had in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** At first I was quite overwhelmed because I did not understand why my user's token was not being saved, this was preventing me from making progress with other functionalities. I finally think I found the reason, is the authContext. The issue is not fixed but I am slowly piecing everything together.

### Day 2: July 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I focused in doing the styles of the Auth App I am creating

**Thoughts:** I am using the global styles of a tutorial, but is quite a complete suite. I think I will work on it an tweak it to make it more mine, is very handy to have a kind of base styles sheet that you can start from in most projects.

### Day 3: July 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today is Sunday. I spent most of my time figuring WordPress out and how to work it locally with XAMPP 

**Thoughts:** I was so clueless, because is a very different set-up than MERN applications

### Day 4: July 8, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today i am bussing, I fixed a bug in my Auth App that was impeding the login to work properly and the deployment issues I was having in Vercel are also gone :) 

**Thoughts:** happy ^^

### Day 5: July 9, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I made good progress on the Auth App, I am slolwy starting to be able to debug my issues and understand the code I need to write to connect back and front. 

**Thoughts:** happy ^^

### Day 6: July 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today i mostly focused on understanding WordPress, I am creating a theme from scratch

**Thoughts:** is a bit messy 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/My-wordpress

### Day 7: July 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I was doing the HTML of this website for a technical task for a WordPress developer role, I have been working on it all day, I think another day and the front end part could be done. 

**Thoughts:** I wanna understand better how to organise efficiently my html/css sheets because it can get quite messy very quickly 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability

### Day 8: July 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: i made progress refactoring the styles and thinking a bit more about how to properly css  

**Thoughts:** not as obvious as I thought at first, I still have a great deal of experimentation ahead of me I think 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability

### Day 9: July 13, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: finally finished the front end part, including the responsive. This  took 14 hours in total (spread over 3 days) 

**Thoughts:** 😵‍💫

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability

### Day 10: July 14, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: make a bit of progress componetizing and uploading it to the remote server 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability

### Day 11: July 15, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: the whole morning doing final details, related to the responsive especially. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 12: July 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I spent so much time traying to understand how to use sass today, and I broke the remote server because of a sftp request that i think included my local database conection details, and replaced the remote db conection details and now I have a 505. Not the best day 

**Thoughts:** breaking is part of the process https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219264748209467394/

**Link to work:** 

### Day 13: July 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I really feel I started understanding what sass is about 

**Thoughts:** is good if you wanna be modular, I love that you can create mixins which are ultimately like functions that take parameters. Quite cool 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability_sass

### Day 14: July 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: spent most of the day understanding how I was going to do the backend part, without having access to the WordPress dashboard of the original ines-test project. In the end I installed a backup of that in a new WordPress in my own server (so that I can control and fix if I break something) 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:**

### Day 15: July 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I finally managed to understand how to do the back-end, focusing on finishing the sass part and then I can do the backend 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability_sass

### Day 16: July 20, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: made some progress in the sass front end, especially reponsive

**Thoughts:**

### Day 17: July 21, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: very annoying day, when I started working on my document the HTML version was not the latest, somehow yesterday's work hadn't been saved. So I had to map everything again and fix an issue with the script. It felt like a wasted day in terms of progress. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 18: July 22, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: started working on the backend

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/rehability-backend

### Day 19: July 23, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: succesfully completed the backend and 

**Thoughts:** very proud!

### Day 20: July 24, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I needed today just to get back into the react mindset and what I had done here. I probably took a break that was too long.  

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 21: July 25, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I was investigating why when I upload an image using multipart the registration gets stuck in a loop. Eventually, I decided I could come back to this, after much investigation. It must be something in the way multer is configured. Then I went on to fix the registration in the front end. I managed. Finally, I was checking to see if I can show the user name in the dashboard. And it worked but as soon as I refreshed it's not there any more. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 22: July 26, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I oficially failed unfortunatly 

**Thoughts:** just have to make shure is not two days in a row

**Link to work:** -

### Day 23: July 27, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Today I was working on solving this -> "the user state is not being rehydrated from local storage after a page refresh, causing the user information to disappear." I also fixed the Registration because it kept returning a message of no

**Thoughts:** I feel like if I manage to understand this issue is gonna be a big milestone in understanding how react works better

### Day 24: July 28, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I did not manage to make progress 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:**

### Day 25: July 29, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today was a good day, I finally figured out what was happening to the user state, why it was disapearing after refreshing. It was because there was a function overwriting the info. I corrected it 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 26: July 30, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I did not push a lot of code at all, but I spend quite a lot of time just thinking and really understanding the whole flow if this app. 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 27: July 31, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I managed to finish the Login with passcode functionality (in reality is changing password to a login code)

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 28: August 1, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: super happy, I finished the change password with autentication, change name and delete user! Bam!

**Thoughts:** slowly picking up a bit of speed :D 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 29: August 2, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: 

- refactor: Update login and registration logic in authContext
Simplify the login and registration logic in the authContext file. Remove the unnecessary token handling and update the user state accordingly. This improves the code readability and reduces complexity.

- made image upload optional in the form

- fixed a package issue with cloudinary

**Thoughts:** i am very excited to see this coming together

### Day 30: August 3, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: went over teh server and tested things 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:** https://github.com/InesMedem/Authentication-System

### Day 31: August 4, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I created a typical counter app to better understand useEffect and useState.
- The state is where the info gets stored when it changes, but it requires useEffect to persist if the page is reloaded, after a page refresh.
- useState only maintains state during the lifecycle of the component, and the state is reset every time the component is re-rendered
- To persist state between page reloads, you can use useEffect in combination with browser storage options like localStorage or sessionStorage.

### Day 37: August 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**:  Today, I explored using the RestCountries API to build a World Explorer App. We discussed fetching data, storing it in IndexedDB to reduce API calls, and creating features like saving countries to favorites. I implemented an IndexedDB service to handle storing, retrieving, and managing country data locally, ensuring efficient data access. Additionally, I learned how to view IndexedDB data in the browser’s Developer Tools, similar to LocalStorage.

**Thoughts:** Working with IndexedDB was insightful. It’s a powerful tool for enhancing app performance and enabling offline capabilities, especially in single-device scenarios. The ability to store and retrieve large datasets locally will be a valuable addition to my projects.
