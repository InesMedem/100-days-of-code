# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 4, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I mostly played around with copilot. I implemented the conditional rendering of the logout button when the user is loged-in, in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** I was a bit frustrated because the actual functionality did not really work, so I am leaving it to tomorrow.

### Day 1: July 5, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I worked on fixing the Context issue I had in the Auth app I am creating. 

**Thoughts:** At first I was quite overwhelmed because I did not understand why my user's token was not being saved, this was preventing me from making progress with other functionalities. I finally think I found the reason, is the authContext. The issue is not fixed but I am slowly piecing everything together.

### Day 2: July 6, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I focused in doing the styles of the Auth App I am creating

**Thoughts:** I am using the global styles of a tutorial, but is quite a complete suite. I think I will work on it an tweak it to make it more mine, is very handy to have a kind of base styles sheet that you can start from in most projects.

### Day 3: July 7, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today is Sunday. I spent most of my time figuring WordPress out and how to work it locally with XAMPP 

**Thoughts:** I was so clueless, because is a very different set-up than MERN applications

### Day 4: July 8, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today i am bussing, I fixed a bug in my Auth App that was impeding the login to work properly and the deployment issues I was having in Vercel are also gone :) 

**Thoughts:** happy ^^

### Day 5: July 9, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I made good progress on the Auth App, I am slolwy starting to be able to debug my issues and understand the code I need to write to connect back and front. 

**Thoughts:** happy ^^

### Day 6: July 10, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today i mostly focused on understanding WordPress, I am creating a theme from scratch

**Thoughts:** is a bit messy

### Day 7: July 11, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I was doing the HTML of this website for a technical task for a WordPress developer role, I have been working on it all day, I think another day and the front end part could be done. 

**Thoughts:** I wanna understand better how to organise efficiently my html/css sheets because it can get quite messy very quickly

### Day 8: July 12, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: i made progress refactoring the styles and thinking a bit more about how to properly css  

**Thoughts:** not as obvious as I thought at first, I still have a great deal of experimentation ahead of me I think

### Day 9: July 13, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: finally finished the front end part, including the responsive. This  took 14 hours in total (spread over 3 days) 

**Thoughts:** 😵‍💫

### Day 12: July 16, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I spent so much time traying to understand how to use sass today, and I broke the remote server because of a sftp request that i think included my local database conection details, and replaced the remote db conection details and now I have a 505. Not the best day 

**Thoughts:** breaking is part of the process https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7219264748209467394/

### Day 13: July 17, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I really feel I started understanding what sass is about 

**Thoughts:** is good if you wanna be modular, I love that you can create mixins which are ultimately like functions that take parameters. Quite cool

### Day 14: July 18, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: spent most of the day understanding how I was going to do the backend part, without having access to the WordPress dashboard of the original ines-test project. In the end I installed a backup of that in a new WordPress in my own server (so that I can control and fix if I break something) 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 15: July 19, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I finally managed to understand how to do the back-end, focusing on finishing the sass part and then I can do the backend 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 16: July 20, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: made some progress in the sass front end, especially reponsive

**Thoughts:**

### Day 17: July 21, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: very annoying day, when I started working on my document the HTML version was not the latest, somehow yesterday's work hadn't been saved. So I had to map everything again and fix an issue with the script. It felt like a wasted day in terms of progress. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 18: July 22, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: started working on the backend

**Thoughts:**

### Day 19: July 23, 2024

### Day 20: July 24, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I needed today just to get back into the react mindset and what I had done here. I probably took a break that was too long.  

**Thoughts:**

### Day 21: July 25, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I was investigating why when I upload an image using multipart the registration gets stuck in a loop. Eventually, I decided I could come back to this, after much investigation. It must be something in the way multer is configured. Then I went on to fix the registration in the front end. I managed. Finally, I was checking to see if I can show the user name in the dashboard. And it worked but as soon as I refreshed it's not there any more. 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 22: July 26, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I oficially failed unfortunatly 

**Thoughts:** just have to make shure is not two days in a row

**Link to work:** -

### Day 23: July 27, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: Today I was working on solving this -> "the user state is not being rehydrated from local storage after a page refresh, causing the user information to disappear." I also fixed the Registration because it kept returning a message of no

**Thoughts:** I feel like if I manage to understand this issue is gonna be a big milestone in understanding how react works better

### Day 24: July 28, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today I did not manage to make progress 

**Thoughts:** 

**Link to work:**

### Day 25: July 29, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: today was a good day, I finally figured out what was happening to the user state, why it was disapearing after refreshing. It was because there was a function overwriting the info. I corrected it 

**Thoughts:**

### Day 26: July 30, 2024 

**Today's Progress**: I did not push a lot of code at all, but I spend quite a lot of time just thinking and really understanding the whole flow if this app. 

**Thoughts:**
